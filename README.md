 ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

 I used to be in a physics degree when in 2021 discovered software development and how it can improve people life.
 Since then i started learning to code by my own and taking curses. 
 Now in 2022 I'm taking a degree in computer science.
 
 Im mostly interest in web development projects.
